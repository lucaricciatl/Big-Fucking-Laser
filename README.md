# High-Power Laser Tube Project

This repository contains the necessary files to build and understand a high-power laser tube, including STL files for 3D printing, CAD files for the full assembly, and a detailed schematic of the circuit. This project is designed for educational and experimental purposes only.

---

## Features

- **3D Model Files**: Includes STL and CAD files for all necessary components, ensuring compatibility with most 3D printers and CAD software.
- **Working Principle**:
  - A DC/DC converter steps up the input voltage to power the flyback transformer.
  - The flyback transformer generates the high voltage required for the laser tube.
  - A MOSFET is used to switch the power circuit, controlled by a simple push-button trigger.
  - The high-voltage arc excites the gas within the laser tube, producing a high-intensity beam of coherent light.
- **Schematic**: Contains a clear circuit diagram illustrating the electrical connections and components.
